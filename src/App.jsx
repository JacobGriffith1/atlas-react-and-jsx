      <Section title="What is react?">
        React is a JavaScript library for building UIs out of small, reusable components. You describe the UI with JSX, pass data via props, and manage state inside componentsâ€”React then updates the browser efficiently for you. It focuses on the view layer, while tools like React Router, TanStack Query, and frameworks like Next.js handle routing, data, and server rendering.
